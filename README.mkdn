This project is a plugin for Emacs to work in conjunction with flymake.el
it displays any flymake error for the current line on the minibuffer.

The project is a fork of http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/flymake-cursor.el

It adds the following features:

 * Customizable delay before the error appears in the minibuffer.
 * Customizable number of errors to display in the minibuffer.
 * Does not overwrite the minibuffer if it's currently in use for user input.
 * Updates message area more consistently as flymake changes state.
 * Turns off when flymake-mode is turned off.
 * Now operates as a minor-mode of its own so you can turn on and off directly.
 * Requires flymake, ensuring a clean byte-compile.
